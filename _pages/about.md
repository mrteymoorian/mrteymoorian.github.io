🧑🏻‍💻 I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu) at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu). I am working at [The Secure, Private Internet (SPIN) Research Group](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~amir/Research.html) under the supervision of Prof. [Amir Houmansadr](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~amir/) and Prof. [Shiqing Ma](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shiqingma/).

👨‍🎓 I earned my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Engineering from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) in 2023.

🔬 My research focuses on Privacy and Security in Generative AI models, with an emphasis on watermarking and model attribution for multi-modal systems, as well as enhancing adversarial robustness in neural networks.
